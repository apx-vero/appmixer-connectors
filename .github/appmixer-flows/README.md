# Appmixer flows that drive this repo's CI

Flows here are **operational**, not connector test flows. They live outside
`src/appmixer/**/artifacts/test-flows`, so the connector e2e tooling never picks
them up and they never show in an e2e report.

## copilot-review-dispatch.json

Fires a `repository_dispatch` event of type `copilot-review` whenever GitHub
Copilot submits a review in this repo, which starts
`.github/workflows/claude-copilot-responder.yml`.

### Why it exists

The responder used to start from a `pull_request_review` event, captured by a
separate trigger workflow and handed over through `workflow_run`. That run is
raised by the **Copilot bot**, which is not a repo collaborator, on a PR whose
head lives in the **apx-vero fork** — so it fell under *Fork pull request
workflows from outside collaborators* and sat on "Approve and run" until a
maintainer clicked it; the `workflow_run` child inherited `actor=Copilot` and was
gated too. Every blocked run this repo ever had was raised by `Copilot`. The
trigger workflow and the `workflow_run` hop are removed; this flow is the only
automatic entry point, and `workflow_dispatch` remains for manual runs.

`repository_dispatch` runs are raised by the **dispatching token's owner**, always
run on the default branch and always receive secrets, so they are never gated.

### Shape

Two components:

- `GitHub / New Review` — repository `Appmixer-ai/appmixer-connectors`, author
  `copilot`, author type `bots`. One event per submitted review.
- `GitHub / Repository Dispatch` — event type `copilot-review`, client payload
  `{"pr_number": "<pull_request_number>", "review_id": "<id>"}`.

**Why New Review and not New Pull Request Review Comment.** Copilot posts one
review holding many inline comments. The comment trigger would emit — and
dispatch — once per comment, all with the same review id; the review trigger
emits once per review, which is exactly the responder's unit of work.

The author filter is a case-insensitive substring match, which matters here:
the same Copilot account is reported as `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]` on
the reviews endpoint this trigger reads, `Copilot` on the review-comments
endpoint and `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` in GraphQL. `copilot` matches all
three; `authorType: bots` keeps a human whose login merely contains the word out.

New Review scans recently updated pull requests in **any** state, so an
approve-then-merge still reaches the flow. The flow deliberately does not filter
by pull request author — the responder only acts on open apx-vero PRs and says
so in its log, which is cheaper than an extra lookup per review here.

### Setup

- The GitHub account bound to both components needs **push access** to
  `Appmixer-ai/appmixer-connectors` — `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/dispatches`
  requires it. `apx-vero` only has `triage`, so bind a writer's account.
- The connector must be published at **github 3.3.0 or newer**; New Review and
  the `pull_request_number` field on its output landed there.
- Import with the account bound, then start it. The flow carries designer
  notes that repeat the points below next to the components they concern.

### When it breaks

- **Dispatch fails with 403 "OAuth App access restrictions".** The
  `Appmixer-ai` org has no grant for the Appmixer GitHub OAuth app (client
  `1c0ed414fe35895cb5ce`) — reads of the public repo still work, which is why
  the trigger looks healthy. An org owner approves the app; then the account
  must be **re-authorized** in Appmixer, because the old token does not pick up
  the grant. Re-authorizing stops flows bound to the account — start this one
  again.
- **Failed dispatches** land in the instance's dead-letter queue
  (`storeUnprocessed`). Retry them only while the flow is running: a retry
  delivered to a stopped flow leaves the queue and is lost.
- **Manual fallback:** run the responder from the Actions tab
  (`workflow_dispatch`) with a PR number, and optionally a review id.

### Duplicates

A retry, or a manual dispatch on top of an automatic one, can hand the same
review over twice. The responder's Resolve step is idempotent: it skips a review
for which its own summary comment already exists with a timestamp after the
review's `submitted_at`. Worst case is one extra ~15 s no-op run.

## apx-vero-mention-dispatch.json

Fires a `repository_dispatch` event of type `apx-vero-mention` when a person
mentions the bot on a PR — in the conversation, inline on a line of the diff,
or in a review body — which starts
`.github/workflows/vero-mention-responder.yml`.

It replaces `claude-pr-author.yml` (#1153, removed in #1169), which listened to
the comment and review events directly. Two of those three events run without
secrets on PRs from forks, and apx-vero's PRs always come from its fork.

### Shape

- `GitHub / New Mention` — the notifications of the account bound to it,
  reason `mention`, limited to the watched repositories.
- `Condition` — the notification is about a pull request
  (`subject.type = PullRequest`). It reads `input` / `operator` / `value`; the
  `field` / `expected` keys some older flows use are ignored by the component,
  which then lets everything through.
- `GitHub / Repository Dispatch` — into the repository the mention came from
  (`repository.full_name`), with `{"pr_url": "<subject.url>"}`.

GitHub keeps one notification per PR thread, so the payload only says "something
on this PR mentions the bot". The workflow validates that `pr_url` is a pull
request of its own repository, then sweeps the PR for every mention with no
reply yet and answers each once. Every reply ends with an
`<!-- apx-vero-mention:<kind>:<id> -->` marker, which is what "answered" means;
a repeated dispatch finds nothing pending and stops.

### Accounts

- **New Mention** reads the notifications of the account it is bound to, so
  bind the **bot** (apx-vero). Its own comments never notify it, which also
  rules out reply loops.
- **Repository Dispatch** needs **push** to the repository — bind a writer.

### Setup

Published as an integration template (see below); the wizard asks for the two
accounts and the repositories to watch. Each watched repository needs
`vero-mention-responder.yml` on its default branch and the `VERO_GH_TOKEN`
and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secrets — the integration only covers the Appmixer half.

## Publishing as integrations

Both flows carry a `wizard` and a `description` and are published on
dev-automated-00001 as integration templates in the category
**appmixer-sanity-hub**, which the appmixer-sanity app's `/automation-hub` page
opens on. Publish or re-publish one with the appmixer-sanity script, pointed at
that instance (run from an appmixer-sanity checkout):

```bash
node --env-file=.env scripts/publish-integration.js <path>/copilot-review-dispatch.json --dry-run
```

How to turn another flow into an integration — the JSON format, wizard fields,
publishing, activating and retiring the old flow:
[appmixer-sanity CLAUDE.md → Migrating a flow to an integration](https://github.com/vtalas/appmixer-sanity/blob/main/CLAUDE.md#migrating-a-flow-to-an-integration).

## pr-hygiene-new-pr.json and pr-hygiene-daily.json

Two integrations that keep pull requests and the
[@appmixer-connectors project](https://github.com/orgs/Appmixer-ai/projects/7)
tidy. They only **warn in Slack** — nothing on a pull request is changed.

The rules:

1. Every pull request either **links an issue** (a closing keyword in its
   description, e.g. `Fixes Appmixer-ai/appmixer-components#N`) or **is itself in
   the project**. A PR whose description says enough on its own does not need an
   issue — but then it goes into the project.
2. Every project item carries a **connector label** — `appmixer:<connector>`,
   one per `bundle.json`, e.g. `appmixer:microsoft:mail` — or
   `non-connector-task`.

### Shape

- **New pull request** — `New Pull Request` → `Wait 1h` → a GraphQL
  `resource(url:)` lookup of the PR (draft, state, linked issues) → `Find
  Project Items` → `Code Block` → `Condition` → Slack. The hour gives the author
  time to link an issue or add the PR to the project. Drafts are skipped; the
  daily check picks them up once they are ready.
- **Daily check** — Monday to Friday, 8:00 Europe/Prague. Lists the open,
  non-draft PRs breaking rule 1 and the project items breaking rule 2, in one
  message. Rule 2 only looks at items **added in the last two days** (the item's
  own `createdAt`, returned by `Find Project Items` since github 3.4.0), so the
  hundreds of older unlabelled items never flood the channel. Nothing is posted
  when both lists are empty.

Linked issues are read through GraphQL with the bound account rather than by
parsing the PR description: the issues live in the private
`appmixer-components` repo, and the account can see it.

### Setup

The wizard asks for three things:

- **GitHub account** — needs `repo` and **`read:project`**. Without the project
  scope `Find Project Items` fails at start with *"Access token not found …
  Calling factory init"*; re-authorize the account from that component.
- **Slack account** — must be a member of the channel.
- **Slack channel** — where the warnings go.

Then start it from the Automation Hub (`/automation-hub` → Use → Start
automation).

### Publishing

Both files are Automation Hub templates, published with appmixer-sanity's
script (its CLAUDE.md, *Migrating a flow to an integration*), from an
appmixer-sanity checkout. Its `.env` may point at another instance — set
`APPMIXER_BASE_URL`, `APPMIXER_USERNAME` and `APPMIXER_PASSWORD` for
dev-automated-00001 in the shell, which wins over the file:

```bash
node --env-file=.env scripts/publish-integration.js <path>/pr-hygiene-new-pr.json --dry-run
node --env-file=.env scripts/publish-integration.js <path>/pr-hygiene-new-pr.json
```

It finds the draft by `name` and the template by the draft (`originFlowId`),
so re-running it updates the same template in place. Do not clone a template to
republish it: the clone is a second card in the hub. Running
instances stay on their revision until
`appmixer integration update-instances <template id>` moves them.

## pr-connector-labels.json

Labels every new pull request with the connector it touches, and every new issue in
`appmixer-components` with the connector its title names, so one search lists a
connector's issues and PRs together across both repositories:
`org:Appmixer-ai label:"appmixer:slack"`.

The labels are one per releasable unit — per `bundle.json` — named after the
connector ref the e2e tooling uses (`appmixer:microsoft:mail`), plus a label per
shared root above several bundles (`appmixer:google`, `appmixer:microsoft`,
`appmixer:aws`, `appmixer:zoho`) for the files it holds itself. A vendor with a
label over GitHub's 50-character limit — the generated MCP server wrappers — gets
one label for all its bundles (`appmixer:mcpservers`). PRs that touch no
connector (CI, scripts, docs) get none, and so does a sweep across more than five
connectors, which would show up in every one of their overviews.

### Shape

Pull requests: `New Pull Request` → `Find Files` ×2 (every `bundle.json` under
`src/appmixer` at the PR's **head commit** and at its **base commit**) → `Make API
Call` (GraphQL `resource(url:)`: the PR's number, repository and changed files) →
`Code Block` (a changed file takes the deepest bundle directory containing it, else
the nearest ancestor that holds bundles) → `Condition` (at least one label) → `Make
API Call` (`POST /repos/{repo}/issues/{number}/labels`) → `Make API Call` (GraphQL
`createLabel` for the same labels in `appmixer-components`).

Issues: `New Issue` (`appmixer-components`, open) → `Find Files` (every `bundle.json`
on `dev`) → `Code Block` (title rule below) → `Condition` → `Make API Call` (`POST
.../issues/{number}/labels`).

The bundle set comes from the repository on every run, so a PR that adds a
connector is labelled with its new label, a PR that removes or renames one with
its old label, and adding a connector needs no change here. Only the first 100
changed files can be read in one request, so a PR changing more than 100 files
gets no labels rather than labels from part of it. The changed files come from
GraphQL because `Find Files` reads a tree, not the diff of a pull request.

**Labels in appmixer-components.** GitHub creates a missing label only in the repo
it is added in, so the PR branch creates every label of the PR in
`appmixer-components` too — one GraphQL call with one aliased `createLabel` per
label. A label that exists already fails on its own alias ("Name has already been
taken"); the others go through and the response is still HTTP 200. A brand-new
connector therefore has its label in both repositories from its first PR on.

**Issue title rule** — only the title, never the body:

- an explicit ref anywhere: `microsoft.mail`, `ai/openai`, `appmixer.ai.typesafe`,
  or a component ref `jira.createIssue`;
- the head of the title (before `: ` or ` - `), each listed name by its first one
  to three words: `Slack: …`, `Google Drive - …`, `slack 5.5.1: …`,
  `Microsoft Teams SendChannelMessage: …`, `Hubspot, Asana: …`; the vendor alone
  gives the shared root label (`Microsoft: …` → `appmixer:microsoft`);
- connector names that are ordinary words (`front`, `box`, `tasks`, `http`, …)
  count only as an explicit ref;
- an issue that already has a connector label, or names more than five, is left alone.

Run against every issue in the repository, the rule agrees with 635 of the 646
labels set so far (by the title-only backfill or by hand) and finds a label for 348
issues that have none.

### Setup

The wizard asks for two GitHub accounts and the two repositories:

- **Reads pull requests and issues** — any account that can read both repositories.
- **Push access** — adds the labels and creates them in `appmixer-components`.
  Creating a label needs push; `apx-vero` has only triage.

`New Issue` polls GitHub search and remembers the issues it has seen, so the first
run only takes a baseline; issues filed before the instance started are not touched.
